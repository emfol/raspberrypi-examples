# The Raspberry Pi Computer

Raspberry Pi is a perfect computer for programmers...
Using its official operating system -- Raspbian -- this little boy
comes with out of the box support for several programming environments
like C/C++, Java, Python, Ruby, Node.js and even more! :-)

This repo is just an example of how versatile this little one can be!
Just clone this repo and type `make` inside the project's folder to see it compile and run a few examples for you!
